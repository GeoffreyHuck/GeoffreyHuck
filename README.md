I mostly work on company projects that are not open-source.

But you can have a glimpse of what I'm doing thanks to [France-IOI](https://www.france-ioi.org), a French association whose aim is to teach algorithmic to young populations, which releases all their projects as open-source.

Relevant projects:
- [AlgoreaBackend](https://github.com/France-ioi/AlgoreaBackend), a backend for an e-learning platform developed with Go
- [Codecast](https://github.com/France-ioi/Codecast), an interactive debugger for Python in the browser developed with Typescript and React

I am a software engineer, consultant and public speaking coach. I love solving tech and strategic challenges.
