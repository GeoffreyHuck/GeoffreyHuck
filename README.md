I mostly work with company projects that are not open-source.

But you can have a glimpse of what I'm doing thanks to France-IOI (https://www.france-ioi.org), a French association which releases all their projects as open-source.

Business owners and project leaders turn to me when:
- They launch a new projects and are afraid to fail
- They are frustrated by the time their developments take
- They are overhelmed by user requests related to bugs in their systems
- They want to improve an existing project

I do consulting, development, and training.

I work independently as a freelancer, so you can contact me directly to talk about your challenges.
